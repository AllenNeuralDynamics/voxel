"""
Controllers are voxel devices that can be shared between multiple voxel devices. \n
Typically for purposes of sending commands to different devices via one control box. \n
Similar to `voxel/instrument/devices/__init__.py` but for controllers.
i.e. controllers must be a subclass of `VoxelDevice` from `voxel/instrument/device.py`. \n
