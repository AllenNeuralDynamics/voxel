# Setting up voxel temperature sensors

## Thorlabs temperature sensor

> [!NOTE]
> To control the Thorlabs TSP0B1 temperature sensor, you will need the DLL file to be in the same directory as the driver file, i.e. ./voxel/devices/temperature_sensor/thorlabs. There is currently no Linux support for this temperature sensor.
